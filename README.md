# unpaywall
Frontend for the Unpaywall project, a set of tools built to index, find, and deliver OA versions of scholarly articles. 

This repo includes the Chrome/Firefox extension, and the website which includes documentation
for the extension, the underlying database, and the API.

The repo for the backend code is [here](https://github.com/impactstory/oadoi) (Unpaywall used to be called oadoi and we haven't gotten around to renaming the repo yet).
